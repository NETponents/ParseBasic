## What is it?
ParseBasic is an interpreter for running simulations for Octoduino programs. ParseBasic is modeled after Basic (hence the name). The goal of ParseBasic is to create a virtualized framework upon which you can create parsers for the Octoduino project.

## Installing
There are two ways to install ParseBasic, depending on your environment.

**WARNING: NOT SUPPORTED YET**

The easiest way, for development machines, is to use pip. Simply just type in 'python pip install parsebasic'.

The other way, which we reccommend for CI environments, is to use GitHub releases. Simply cURL the target release to your directory, unzip/untar the archive, then run 'python ./pb.py'.

## How can I learn ParseBasic?
Take a look at the documentation. We will have code examples coming soon in another release.

## Contributing
The easiest way to contribute is to leave a tip using Gratipay. Just click the *tips* badge above. If you know Python, you can also leave a code contribution. Just ask us if you see an issue you like and we can assign it to you. Then just fork the project to your own GitHub account and begin work. When you are done, open a PR and a project collaborator will get back to ASAP.
